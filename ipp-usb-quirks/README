This directory contains a collection of quirks files for various
devices.

Each file consist of sections, each section contains various parameters:

[Device Name]
  http-xxx  = yyy
  blacklist = false | true

When searching for quirks for a particular device, device name is
matched against section names. Section names may contain a glob-style
wildcards (* or ?). If device name must contain one of these characters,
use \ as escape.

All matching sections are taken in consideration and sorted in priority
order. Priority is ordered by amount of matched non-wildcard characters.
The more non-wildcard characters are matched, the more the priority

If some parameter was found in multiple sections, the value for most
prioritized section is taken

The following parameters are recognized:

  blacklist = true | false        - blacklist or not the matching devices
  disable-fax = true | false      - disable fax capability, even if present
  http-xxx  = yyy                 - set HTTP header Xxx: yyy
  http-xxx  = ""                  - drop HTTP header Xxx
  ignore-ipp-status = true|false  - If enabled, ignore IPP status of requests
                                    that ipp-usb has sent by itself. It
                                    affects only ipp-usb initialization
  init-reset = none | soft | hard - should USB reset be performed on start
  init-delay = NNN                - delay, in milliseconds, between device
                                    is opened and, optionally, reset and
                                    the first request is sent to device
  init-reset = none | soft | hard - how to reset device during initialization,
                                    default is none
  request-delay = NNN             - delay, in milliseconds, between
                                    subsequent requests
  usb-max-interfaces = N          - use no more that N first USB interfaces
