.SH "NAME"
\fBipp\-usb\fR \- Daemon for IPP over USB printer support
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBipp\-usb\fR daemon enables driver\-less printing and scanning on USB\-only AirPrint\-compatible printers and MFPs\.
.P
It works by connecting to the device by USB using IPP\-over\-USB protocol, and exposing the device to the network, including DNS\-SD (ZeroConf) advertising\.
.P
IPP printing, eSCL scanning and web console are fully supported\.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.SS "Usage:"
\fBipp\-usb mode [options]\fR
.SS "Modes are:"
.TP
\fBstandalone\fR
run forever, automatically discover IPP\-over\-USB devices and serve them all
.TP
\fBudev\fR
like standalone, but exit when last IPP\-over\-USB device is disconnected
.TP
\fBdebug\fR
logs duplicated on console, \-bg option is ignored
.TP
\fBcheck\fR
check configuration and exit\. It also prints a list of all connected devices
.TP
\fBstatus\fR
print status of the running \fBipp\-usb\fR daemon, including information of all connected devices
.SS "Options are"
.TP
\fB\-bg\fR
run in background (ignored in debug mode)
.SH "NETWORKING"
Essentially, \fBipp\-usb\fR makes printer or scanner accessible from the network, converting network\-side HTTP operations to the USB operations\.
.P
By default, \fBipp\-usb\fR exposes device only to the loopback interface, using the \fBlocalhost\fR address (both \fB127\.0\.0\.1\fR and \fB::1\fR, for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively)\. TCP ports are allocated automatically, and allocation is persisted in the association with the particular device, so the next time the device is plugged on, it will get the same port\. The default port range for TCP ports allocation is \fB60000\-65535\fR\.
.P
This default behavior can be changed, using configuration file\. See \fBCONFIGURATION\fR section below for details\.
.P
If you decide to publish your device to the real network, the following things should be taken into consideration:
.IP "1." 4
Your \fBprivate\fR device will become \fBpublic\fR and it will become accessible by other computers from the network
.IP "2." 4
Firewall rules needs to be updated appropriately\. The \fBipp\-usb\fR daemon will not do it automatically by itself
.IP "3." 4
IPP over USB specification explicitly require that the \fBHost\fR field in the HTTP request is set to \fBlocalhost\fR or \fBlocalhost:port\fR\. If device is accessed from the real network, \fBHost\fR header will reflect the real network address\. Most of devices allow it, but some are more restrictive and will not work in this configuration\.
.IP "" 0
.SH "DNS\-SD (AVAHI INTEGRATION)"
IPP over USB is intended to be used with the automatic device discovery, and for this purpose \fBipp\-usb\fR advertises all devices it handles, using DNS\-SD protocol\. On Linux, DNS\-SD is handled with a help of Avahi daemon\.
.P
DNS\-SD advertising can be disabled via configuration file\. Also, if Avahi is not installed or not running, \fBipp\-usb\fR will still work correctly, although DNS\-SD advertising will not work\.
.P
For every device the following services will be advertised:
.TS
allbox;
l l l.
Instance	Type	Subtypes
Device name	_ipp\._tcp	_universal\._sub\._ipp\._tcp
Device name	_printer\._tcp	\~
Device name	_uscan\._tcp	\~
Device name	_http\._tcp	\~
BBPP	_ipp\-usb\._tcp	\~
.TE
.P
Notes:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBDevice name\fR is the name under which device appears in the list of available devices, for example, in the printing dialog (it is DNS\-SD device name, in another words), and for most of devices will match the device's model name\. It is appended with the \fB" (USB)"\fR suffix, so if device is connected via network and via USB simultaneously, these two connections can be easily distinguished\. If there are two devices with the same name connected simultaneously, the suffix becomes \fB" (USB NNN)"\fR, with NNN number unique for each device, for disambiguation\. In another words, the single \fB"Kyocera ECOSYS M2040dn"\fR device will be listed as \fB"Kyocera ECOSYS M2040dn (USB)"\fR, and two such a devices will be listed as \fB"Kyocera ECOSYS M2040dn (USB 1)"\fR and \fB"Kyocera ECOSYS M2040dn (USB 2)"\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB_ipp\._tcp\fR and \fB_printer\._tcp\fR are only advertises for printer devices and MFPs
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB_uscan\._tcp\fR is only advertised for scanner devices and MFPs
.IP "\(bu" 4
for the \fB_ipp\._tcp\fR service, the \fB_universal\._sub\._ipp\._tcp\fR subtype is also advertised for iOS compatibility
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB_printer\._tcp\fR is advertised with TCP port set to 0\. Other services are advertised with the actual port number
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB_http\._tcp\fR is device web\-console\. It is always advertises in assumption it is always exist
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBBBPP\fR, used for the \fB_ipp\-usb\._tcp\fR service, is the USB bus (BB) and port (PP) numbers in hex\. The purpose of this advertising is to help CUPS and other possible "clients" to guess which devices are handled by the \fBipp\-usb\fR service, to avoid possible conflicts with the legacy USB drivers\.
.IP "" 0
.SH "Matching DNS\-SD announcements against local USB bus"
Client software may need to match local devices exposed by \fBipp\-usb\fR with those found on the local USB bus\. This can be useful, for example, to avoid offering USB devices in the print or scan dialog that cannot be used because they are already in use by \fBipp\-usb\fR\.
.P
As a rough guideline, clients might consider USB devices that offer interfaces with Class=7, SubClass=1, and Protocol=4 as belonging to \fBipp\-usb\fR\. However, this is not a precise method\. Some devices may not properly implement the IPP over USB protocol and could be blacklisted in the \fBipp\-usb\fR configuration for this reason\. Additionally, some devices may be automatically recognized by \fBipp\-usb\fR as incompatible and thus skipped\. It's also possible that \fBipp\-usb\fR is disabled on the system entirely\.
.P
A more reliable approach is to directly query the running \fBipp\-usb\fR instance to determine which devices it actually handles\.
.P
To facilitate the matching of devices that \fBipp\-usb\fR manages and announces via DNS\-SD against local devices found on the USB bus, \fBipp\-usb\fR adds two TXT records to each \fB_ipp\._tcp\fR, \fB_printer\._tcp\fR, and \fB_uscan\._tcp\fR services it announces:
.IP "\(bu" 4
usb_SER=VCF9192281 \- USB serial number for the device
.IP "\(bu" 4
usb_HWID=0482&069d \- USB vendor and hardware ID for the device in hex
.IP "" 0
.P
Please note that when matching devices discovered via DNS\-SD with USB devices, it is important to only consider DNS\-SD advertisements from IP addresses that are either loopback addresses (127\.0\.0\.1 or ::1) or belong to a local interface\.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
\fBipp\-usb\fR searched for its configuration file in two places:
.IP "1." 4
\fB/etc/ipp\-usb/ipp\-usb\.conf\fR
.IP "2." 4
\fBipp\-usb\.conf\fR in the directory where executable file is located
.IP "" 0
.P
Configuration file syntax is very similar to \.INI files syntax\. It consist of named sections, and each section contains a set of named variables\. Comments are started from # or ; characters and continues until end of line:
.IP "" 4
.nf
# This is a comment
[section 1]
variable 1 = value 1  ; and another comment
variable 2 = value 2
.fi

.SS "Network parameters"
Network parameters are all in the \fB[network]\fR section:

  # Android devices\.
  interface = loopback # all | loopback

  # Enable or disable IPv6
  ipv6 = enable        # enable | disable
.fi
.IP "" 0
.SS "Authentication"
By default, \fBipp\-usb\fR exposes locally connected USB printer to all users of the system\.
.P
Though this is reasonable behavior in most cases, when computer and printer are both in personal use, for bigger installation this approach can be too simple and primitive\.
.P
\fBipp\-usb\fR provides a mechanism, which allows to control local clients access based on UID the client program runs under\.
.P
Please note, this mechanism will not work for remote connections (disabled by default but supported)\. Authentication of remote users requires some different mechanism, which is under consideration but is not yet implemented\.
.P
Note also, this mechanism may or may not work in containerized installation (i\.e\., snap, flatpak and similar)\. The container namespace may be isolated from the system and/or user's namespaces, so even for local clients the UID as seen by the \fBipp\-usb\fR may be different from the system\-wide UID\.
.P
Authentication parameters are all in the [auth uid] section:
.IP "" 4
.nf
# Local user authentication by UID/GID
[auth uid]
  # Syntax:
  #     operations = users
  #
  # Operations are comma\-separated list of following operations:
  #     all    \- all operations
  #     config \- configuration web\-console
  #     fax    \- faxing
  #     print  \- printing
  #     scan   \- scanning
  #
  # Users have the following suntax:
  #     user   \- user name
  #     @group \- all users that belongs to the group
  #
  # Users and groups may be specified either by names or by
  # numbers\. "*" means any
  #
  # Note, if user/group is not known in the context of request
  # (for example, in the case of non\-local network connection),
  # "*" used for matching, which will only match wildcard
  # rules\.
  #
  # User/group names are resolved at the moment of request
  # processing (and cached for a couple of seconds), so running
  # daemon will see changes to the /etc/passwd and /etc/group
  #
  # Examples:
  #     fax, print = lp, @lp   # Allow CUPS to do its work
  #     scan       = *         # Allow any user to scan
  #     config     = @wheel    # Only wheel group members can do that

.SS "Quirks"
Some devices, due to their firmware bugs, require special handling, called device\-specific \fBquirks\fR\. \fBipp\-usb\fR loads quirks from the \fB/usr/share/ipp\-usb/quirks/*\.conf\fR files and from the \fB/etc/ipp\-usb/quirks/*\.conf\fR files\. The \fB/etc/ipp\-usb/quirks\fR directory is for system quirks overrides or admin changes\. These files have \.INI\-file syntax with the content that looks like this:
.IP "" 4
.nf
# Various HP printers \- match by bame
[HP LaserJet MFP M28\-M31]
  http\-connection = keep\-alive

[HP OfficeJet Pro 8730]
  http\-connection = close

[HP Inc\. HP Laser MFP 135a]
  blacklist = true

# Xerox B210\. Match by HWID, as model name is not reliable
# before reset\.
[0924:42ea]
  mfg        = Xerox
  model      = B210
  init\-reset = hard


# Default configuration
[*]
  http\-connection = ""
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
Section name defines the device (or group of devices) quirks are applied to, and section body contains the applied quirks\.
.P
For each discovered device, quirks are searched by the USB HWID (Vendor:Product, in hex) and by the model name\.
.P
Section names may contain wildcards:
.IP "" 4
.nf
`[HP OfficeJet Pro 8730]` \- match the "HP OfficeJet Pro 8730" device
`[HP OfficeJet *]`        \- match all models with name started with
                            the "HP OfficeJet" prefix\.
`[0924:42ea]`             \- match the device with the USB HWID 0924:42ea
`[0924:*]`                \- match all devices with the Vendor ID equal
                            to 0924 (this ID owned by Xerox)\.
.fi
.IP "" 0
.P
Model names may contain glob\-style wildcards: \fB*\fR that matches any sequence of characters and \fB?\fR , that matches any single character\. To match one of these characters (\fB*\fR and \fB?\fR) literally, use backslash as escape\.
.P
HWID sections may only contain a \fB*\fR wildcard in a place of the Product ID\.
.P
Note, the simplest way to guess the exact model name for the particular device is to use \fBipp\-usb check\fR command, which prints a list of all connected devices\. To obtain list if USB HWIDs, use the \fBlsusb\fR command\.
.P
If some parameter found in multiple matching sections, \fBipp\-usb\fR follows the principle: most specific match wins\.
.P
To be more precise, the following prioritization algorithm is used:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The exact HWID (non\-wildcard, i\.e\., \fB[0924:42ea]\fR) considered the most specific\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The next candidates are model name match with at least one matched non\-wildcard character\. If there are multiple model name matches, amount of non\-wildcard matched characters is counted, and the longer match wins\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The next candidate is the wildcard HWID match (i\.e\., \fB[0924:*]\fR)\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
And the least specific is the all\-wildcard model name match (i\.e\., \fB[*]\fR)\.
.IP "" 0
.P
In a case of multiple matches even after applying this algorithm, the first definition wins\. Files are loaded in alphabetical order, sections read sequentially
.P
In another words, non\-wildcard HWID match considered most specific, model name matches are ranked by the amount of non\-wildcard matched characters, and wildcard HWID match considered less specific as any of above, because it can only be applied to all devices of the particular vendor, and the least specific is the all\-wildcard model name match, used to specify defaults\.
.P
Please notice that HWID\-matched quirks are loaded early and may cause some actions to be performed before the model\-name matched quirks are loaded and applied, and the model\-name matched quirks cannot withdraw these early performed actions\. It happens because some printers cannot reliably report their model name before appropriate actions is applied\. It is related to the following quirks:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBblacklist = true\fR\. Model\-name quirks will not be loaded if device is blacklisted by HWID\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBinit\-reset = hard\fR\. Reset will be issued, even if model\-name matched quirk has a different setting\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBmfg = name\fR and \fBmodel = name\fR\. These parameters are only available for the HWID quirks and override identification information, provided by the device, when searching quirks by the model name\.
.IP "" 0
.P
The following parameters are defined:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBblacklist = true | false\fR
.br
If \fBtrue\fR, the matching device is ignored by the \fBipp\-usb\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBbuggy\-ipp\-responses = reject | allow | sanitize\fR
.br
Some devices send buggy (malformed) IPP responses that violate IPP specification\. \fBipp\-usb\fR may \fBreject\fR these responses (so \fBipp\-usb\fR initialization will fail), \fBallow\fR them (\fBipp\-usb\fR initialization will succeed, but CUPS needs to accept them as well) or \fBsanitize\fR them (fix IPP specs violations)\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBdisable\-fax = true | false\fR
.br
If \fBtrue\fR, the matching device's fax capability is ignored\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBhttp\-XXX = YYY\fR
.br
Set XXX header of the HTTP requests forwarded to device to YYY\. If YYY is empty string, XXX header is removed\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBignore\-ipp\-status = true | false\fR
.br
If \fBtrue\fR, IPP status of IPP requests sent by the \fBipp\-usb\fR by itself will be ignored\. This quirk is useful, when device correctly handles IPP request but returned status is not reliable\. Affects only \fBipp\-usb\fR initialization\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBinit\-delay = DELAY\fR
.br
Delay, between device is opened and, optionally, reset, and the first request is sent to device\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBinit\-retry\-partial = true | false\fR
.br
Retry the initialization in case only part of the device's functions have been initialized, instead of continuing to operate with incomplete functionality\.
.IP
It can be useful if the device takes a long time to fully initialize\. During this period, some components may respond normally while others are still initializing\. For example, the device may quickly report its scanning capabilities shortly after startup, while its printing functionality may take several minutes to become operational\.
.IP
Some enterprise\-level HP printers are known to have this problem\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBinit\-reset = none | soft | hard\fR
.br
How to reset device during initialization\. Default is \fBnone\fR

Timeout for HTTP requests send by the \fBipp\-usb\fR during initialization\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBmfg = name\fR

Overrides the USB manufacturer (vendor) name\. This quirk can only be used in the HWID section and affects searching quirks by model name\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBmodel = name\fR
.br
Overrides the USB model (product) name\. This quirk can only be used in the HWID section and affects searching quirks by model name\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBrequest\-delay = DELAY\fR

\fBusb\-max\-interfaces = N\fR
.br
Don't use more that N USB interfaces, even if more is available\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBusb\-send\-delay = DELAY\fR
.br
Delay between low\-level USB send\-to\-device requests (this is not the same as \fBrequest\-delay\fR, which inserts delays between the whole HTTP\-level requests)\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBusb\-send\-delay\-threshold = N\fR
.br
\fBusb\-send\-delay\fR only applied if USB send\-to\-device request size exceeds this threshold\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBzlp\-recv\-hack = true | false\fR
.br
Some enterprise\-level HP devices, during the initialization phase (which can last several minutes), may respond with an HTTP 503 status or similar, which is expected\. However, the response body may be truncated (typically, the terminating '\en' is lost)\. In such cases, \fBipp\-usb\fR will wait indefinitely for a response to maintain synchronization with the device\.
.IP
At the same time, these devices send a zero\-length UDP packet at the end of the truncated output\. If the \fBzlp\-recv\-hack\fR quirk is enabled, when ipp\-usb receives a zero\-length packet from the USB followed by a receive timeout, it interprets this combination of events as a valid termination of the response body\. It works only at the initialization time and doesn't affect futher operations\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBzlp\-send = true | false\fR
.br
Terminate outgoing transfers that a multiple of the endpoint's packet size win an extra zero length packet\.
.IP "" 0
.P
The DELAY parameter can be specified either as an unsigned integer (in milliseconds) or as a sequence of decimal numbers with an optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms," "0\.5s," or "2m30s\." Valid time units are "ns," "us" (or "µs"), "ms" "s" "m" and "h"
.P
If you found out about your device that it needs a quirk to work properly or it does not work with \fBipp\-usb\fR at all, although it provides IPP\-over\-USB interface, please report the issue at https://github\.com/OpenPrinting/ipp\-usb\. It will let us to update our collection of quirks, so helping other owners of such a device\.
